# android-dice-game-university-project

Project I made during a university course in mobile app development. 
The game is an Android game and can be run on your phone, provided you know how to install games on an android phone.

(Or you can emulate it using any preferred emulator)

The project isn't intended to be perfect, but was made to pass an exam.
